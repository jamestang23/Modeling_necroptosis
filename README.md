# Mathematic modeling for necroptosis
Matlab code for mathematical modeling on signaling regulations for necroptosis.

There are two models. One is the conceptual model to demonstrate the cell death with constitutive protective protein or induced protective protein. The other one is full model constructed to model the signaling regulations for necroptosis. The full model is based on the model
