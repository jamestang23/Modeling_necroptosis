# Mathematic modeling for necroptosis
Matlab code for mathematical modeling on signaling regulations for necroptosis.

There are two models. One is the conceptual model to demonstrate the cell death with constitutive protective protein or induced protective protein. The other one is full model constructed to model the signaling regulations for necroptosis. The full model is based on the NFkB signaling model in https://github.com/biomystery/tnf_ikbd_nfkb_model.git, and further add the signaling molecules of necroptosis. 

To run the conceptual model, go to the folder ConceptualModel and run DeathConcept4.m.

To run the full model, go to the folder FullModel and run NecroptosisMain1.m.

The details of the model can be found in the manuscript [].
